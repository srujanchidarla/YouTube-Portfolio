        <b>A Journey Rooted in Hard Work and Resilience</b>
      </h3>
      <hr className="pb-4" />
      <p>
        <b className="block">The Beginning:</b> Growing Up in a Village I take
        immense pride in my roots, having grown up in a humble village. My
        village life taught me the essence of hard work, the importance of
        morals, and the value of helping others. These early lessons have stayed
        with me, shaping my character and guiding my journey ever since. Back
        then, even one rupee held immense value, and those simple yet profound
        experiences made me appreciate the little things in life.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        I started my education in a local school, where the foundation of my
        learning was laid. Later, I moved to a state public school known for its
        focus on sports. It was here that I developed a passion for sports,
        mastering handball, and track and field athletics, competing at state
        and national levels, and becoming physically strong. Sports not only
        taught me discipline but also made me realize the importance of physical
        activity in keeping the body active and the mind sharp.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        <b className="block">An Early Love for Learning</b> While excelling in
        sports, I found myself captivated by social studies, particularly
        history and current affairs. At school, newspapers arrived daily, and I
        would tear out interesting articles on historical topics, collecting and
        connecting them in a notebook. This early habit of curiosity and
        analysis instilled in me a love for lifelong learning. Even now, I
        continue to follow current affairs and daily news, a routine that keeps
        me informed and engaged with the world.

          The Pillars of Support: My Grandparents&apos; Role
        </b>
        In addition to my parents, my grandfather and grandmother played a
        significant role in shaping my journey. They were always there for my
        family, especially during tough times, providing both emotional and
        financial support when we needed it the most.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        One of the most pivotal moments came during my bachelor&apos;s degree
        when my grandparents gifted me a laptop—an essential tool that enabled
        me to explore programming and excel in my field. This act of support
        fueled my passion for learning and technology, reminding me of the value
        of having a family that stands by you in every phase of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b className="block">Pursuing Education: A Journey of Determination</b>
        After completing school, I enrolled in a diploma program in mining
        engineering. Although this field wasn’t my dream, I chose it with a
        practical goal in mind: to secure a job quickly and support my family.
        Coming from a middle-class family, I understood the sacrifices that many
        people like me have to make, often setting aside dreams to prioritize
        responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        During my diploma studies, I excelled academically and even took on the
        role of teaching my fellow students. This experience made me realize the
        power of education and knowledge in transforming lives. However, deep
        down, I knew that mining wasn’t my true calling.

          A Turning Point: Finding My Path in Computer Science
        </b>
        After completing my diploma, I planned to pursue a bachelor’s degree in
        the same field, but unforeseen circumstances led to the discontinuation
        of my course in the state. This left me confused and uncertain about my
        future. Refusing to let the setback hold me back, I turned to Google,
        exploring alternative options. After much research, I decided to pursue
        a degree in computer science, recognizing its vast potential and
        alignment with my interests.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        I appeared for an entrance exam, achieved a good rank, and secured a
        spot at a reputable college. Moving to a city for the first time was a
        major cultural shift for me. Coming from a village lifestyle, I
        initially struggled with adjusting to the fast-paced urban environment
        and learning how to interact with people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b className="block">Adapting to City Life: Growth and Confidence</b>
        In those early weeks, I was fortunate to meet supportive classmates who
        helped me navigate this new world. Slowly, I began to understand myself
        better, set aside my fears, and adapt to the city lifestyle. My
        bachelor&apos;s journey became a transformative phase, where I gained
        not just academic knowledge but also life lessons, such as understanding
        people, developing ideas, and embracing new perspectives.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        By the time I completed my bachelor’s degree, I had grown in confidence
        and capability, stepping out of my comfort zone and equipping myself
        with the skills and mindset needed to pursue my dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b className="block">Conclusion: A Foundation for the Future</b>
        Looking back, my journey from a small village to a city college is a
        testament to perseverance, resilience, and the power of education. It
        reflects the reality faced by many in middle-class families, where
        sacrifices often pave the way for growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The values of hard work, curiosity, and adaptability that I learned in
        my early years continue to guide me. The support of my parents and
        grandparents, combined with my determination, has laid a strong
        foundation for my future. These experiences have taught me that setbacks
        are merely stepping stones to success and that every challenge brings
        with it an opportunity to grow and evolve.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        As I move forward, I carry with me the lessons of my past, the strength
        of my roots, and the determination to build a brighter future—not just
        for myself but for those who have supported me along the way.
